# nixie-clock

A beautiful, old school, Nixie tubes face clock for the #FlutterClock challenge.

## Nixie Animations

This clock has been developed in Flutter with simplicity in mind. I was inspired by this old cathode tubes, unfortunately no more available on the market. Therefore, I decided to bring them back and build this face clock.

The digit tubes and the dots tubes are created using Flare. Animations are also made with Flare.
The tubes are put on a simple wooden board, which will also display the location, weather and temperature.
